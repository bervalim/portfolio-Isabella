          <p>What worked well?</p>
          <p>
            Clearly defining the industryâ€™s pain points provided a solid
            foundation for the project. Developing detailed user journey
            mappings helped us empathize with user needs and align features with
            their workflows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Categorizing products and features with logical hierarchies made
            navigation intuitive for users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, testing specific workflows provided actionable
            insights into user behavior, allowing us to refine the design
            further.

          <p>What would I do differently?</p>
          <p>
            Incorporating more complex tasks, such as handling multiple
            quotations or order modifications, could better mimic actual user
            workflows and uncover hidden pain points.
          </p>
          <p>
            A/B testing multiple versions of key features (e.g., navigation
            styles, filtering mechanisms) could provide data-driven insights for
            final designs.
